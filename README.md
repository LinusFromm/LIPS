# LIPS

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

LIPS (Linear Inverse Problem Samplers) is a package created alongside my
PhD thesis which is meant to implement all samplers created during my
PhD. This includes different exension samplers and weighted move
samplers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LIPS from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("LinusFromm/LIPS")
```

## Example

So far there are no examples they will be added as the package gets more
developed. So far the focus is on development rather than presentation.

``` r
library(LIPS)
## basic example code
```
